# Cache-Performance
This project studies the effect of the cache parameters on its performance.

This project contains the following files

1) source code: 
	cache_simulator.cpp -> main file implementaion that implements the set-associative cache
 
2) Report: 
	contains the details of the implementation and experiments, in addtion to analyzing the graphs we get from the data sheet. 

3) Exp1: 
	contains the data we collected from experiment 1 and its corresponding graphs.

4) Exp2:
	contains the data we collected from experiment 2 and its corresponding graphs.

5) test_cases:
	contains the test cases and the method we used to validate the implementation of the cache.
